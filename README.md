# Super Mario 64 AP Tracker Pack for PopTracker

This is a SM64 AP Tracker for PopTracker. Designed around the Archipelago version of the randomizer, setup for auto-tracking as well. 

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases section, and then move it into `/poptracker/packs/` and you're all set!

## Notes

It doesn't track the recieved items (keys, caps or cannons), since they can be check easily in-game in the start menu, but maybe I will fin a place in the tracker for them.

## More Info

## Connecting to AP

To connect to the AP server for auto-tracking, click on the `AP` button at the top of the tracker and a seperate window should pop up asking for you to "__enter archipelago server port__", in which you should type in `archipelago.gg:PORT_NUMBER` (or whatever ip/port combination you're connecting to), select `OK` and then continue to enter in your __Slot name__ and the __password__ to the room (if there is one). Once complete, the `AP` button at the top of the tracker window should turn "Green" meaning you are now auto-tracking!
